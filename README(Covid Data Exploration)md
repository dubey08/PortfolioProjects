# Covid Data Exploration

The Covid-19 pandemic has had several short-term and long-term impacts on human health, society, economy, and environment. A pandemic that broke out in 2019 created significant knock-on effects on daily life and the global economy.

Presently, the impacts of COVID-19 on daily life are extensive and have far-reaching consequences.

In this project, I analyzed and explored Covid-19 data with SQL using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

This Covid-19 data was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) starting from January 1, 2020, to November 5, 2022.
